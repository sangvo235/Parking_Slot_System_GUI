PROJECT TITLE:                  GUI Parking Spot System

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:             To develop a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based on the functions 
                                developed in the previous project i.e. change from console interface to GUI.
                                Clear representation of a parking slot system where users can search, add or delete
                                slots and cars. To show comprehension in Objected Orientated Programming, advanced 
                                features are also added to develop visual hierarchy and prototypicality within the 
                                GUI. This included displaying parking times, time elapsed, removing and adding car directly from
                                the slots.
